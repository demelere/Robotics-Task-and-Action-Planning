### Robotics Task and Action Planning

This project is an exploration of approaches to robotics task and action planning.  It compares and contrasts classical approaches like state space planning, plan space planning, planning graphs, and partial order planning with generative AI approaches like diffusion.  The diffusion approach uses a transformer base instead of the U-Net which is often used for image generation.

Venv was created `python3 -m venv myenv`
